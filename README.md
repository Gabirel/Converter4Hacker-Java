# Converter4Hacker-Java
This program is only for hackers to do their jobs quickly, especially in encoding, decoding and etc.


# It looks like this
![Program-Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gabirel/Converter4Hacker-Java/master/demo/LayoutDemo.png)

The idea originated from http://programming.rs/hackers-toolkit Becase this add-on in chrome doesn't work very well. Now it is aborted by me. Hard to use, I wanna say.

JavaFX is used to make it happen!


# Attention
1. This project is ACTIVE now. So, if you have any new ideas, tell me
2. Although this thing looks still so ugly, but I can promise you that it has almost 99.9995% validity. And I will improve that.
3. It still has some bugs on the menu's event. I will handle it.
